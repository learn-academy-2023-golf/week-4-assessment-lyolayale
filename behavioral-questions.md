# ASSESSMENT 4: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Why did you choose a career in software development?

- Nugget: The reason I chose a career in software development, it started as a challenge ...
- Situation: It was the year of COVID-19. As with a lot of individuals I got laid off during COVID.
- Task: I needed to figure out my next step and I wanted a change; I want to self-improve.
- Action: I decided to go back to college and complete my bachelors degree and upon completing my degree, I was like now what? I want to learn more, but learn what? I want to learn something hard, something difficult. So ... I started dabbling and teaching myself web development (this process was slow and tedious and did mean extremely slow!), after researching, I naturally started with HTML (again, slow and tedious, lol).
- Result: I became addicted to learning, struggling, and everything that software development has to offer.

2. In previous roles, how have you helped teammates succeed?

- Nugget: A long time ago, when I was in OSUT training in the military, there was a soldier that was struggling to pass his run time on his physical fitness test. And, if he fails once more, he will not be allowed to graduate as a scout.
- Situation: Phyical fitness test time. His last chance to pass the run portion.
- Task: Make sure the soldier completes the run in the alotted time.
- Action: I stay with soldier during the entire run and keep track of time to ensure he passes the run within the alottted time. (pair running).
- Result: We both complete the run within the alotted time and the soldier finally gets to graduate as a scout.
